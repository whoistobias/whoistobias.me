# I'm [Tobias](#)

I am a **maker**. My passion, design, is the union of aesthetic and function. Design is informed and intentional.

To be specific, I make websites, apps, and games. I derive great joy bringing ideas into existence by creating beautiful, interactive experiences that reflect purpose and capture fundamental human emotions. I'm always working on my next big idea.

I've worked in a variety of roles in a breadth of systems and fields. I have extensive experience in commerce, especially in the enterprise business to business space.
