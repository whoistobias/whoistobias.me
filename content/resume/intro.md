Iâ€™ve always had an eye for aesthetics and an aptitude for logic. The intentionality of design, which merges the two, invited me to learn web development.

I am a jack of all trades, driven by endless curiosity and a constant desire to know how things work. Challenge excites me. Self improvement is my reward while empowering others through knowledge is my legacy. I deeply enjoy my craft.

With that said, I prefer to let my work quality and ethic speak for themselves.
